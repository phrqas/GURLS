Introduction
============

The pyGURLS wrapper allows GURLS++ to be easily integrated as a module 
within SciPy. It is currently implemented as a Python extension module
written in Cython and performs data I/O using NumPy. The demos folder
provides the user with a number of examples that demonstrate the 
current capabilities of the package.

Installation
============

Before building pyGURLS, make sure that:

- GURLS++ has been correctly built;
- the shared library libgurls++.so has been generated and installed (usually
located at /usr/local/lib); 
- NumPy, Scipy, and Cython are installed. 

Let <GURLS-HOME> be the folder where GURLS has been downloaded. In order to build 
and install pyGURLS, it should be sufficient to do the following:

    cd <GURLS-HOME>/pygurls
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will make the Python module pygurls available for use. In order to be
able to import it from any folder, you should add <GURLS-HOME>/pygurls
to the environment variable PYTHONPATH.

    export PYTHONPATH=<GURLS-HOME>/pygurls:$PYTHONPATH

If everything has been correctly installed, you should be able to import pyGURLS into
your Python session by issuing

    import pygurls

Troubleshooting
----------------

- If you're missing any of pyGURLS' Python dependencies, you can easily install
them using Python package managers such as pip and easy_install. Assuming that you
are using pip, you can install the most up-to-date versions of the packages by 
issuing

    sudo pip install -U numpy scipy cython

- If the command 

    import pygurls

fails with an error that says that libgurls++.so hasn't been found, it is probably
because it hasn't been installed in a folder within your linkage path. The easiest 
way to fix this is to add /usr/local/lib (or whatever folder you've chosen to install
libgurls++.so in) to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

- If you would like to make the changes to PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH permanent,
you should add the aforementioned export commands to your terminal initialization 
script (e.g., ~/.bashrc in Ubuntu).
