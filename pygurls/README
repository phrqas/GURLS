Introduction
============

The pyGURLS wrapper allows GURLS++ to be easily integrated as a module 
within SciPy. It is currently implemented as a Python extension module
written in Cython and performs data I/O using NumPy. The demos folder
provides the user with a number of examples that demonstrate the 
current capabilities of the package.

Installation
============

Before building pyGURLS, make sure that GURLS++ has been correctly built
and that the shared librariy libgurls++.so can be found by ld. Also, make
sure that you have NumPy, Scipy, and Cython installed. Let <GURLS-HOME> be 
the folder where GURLS has been downloaded. In order to build and install 
pyGURLS, it should be sufficient to do the following:

    cd <GURLS-HOME>/pygurls
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will make the Python module pygurls available for use. In order to be
able to import it from any folder, you should add <GURLS-HOME>/pygurls
to the environment variable PYTHONPATH.

export PYTHONPATH=<GURLS-HOME>/pygurls:$PYTHONPATH

If pyGURLS' Python dependencies are installed, you can easily get them using
pip

    sudo pip install -U numpy scipy cython
